# Spector
---

Spector is a generative SCSS library based heavily on [basscss](http://basscss.com).

Where basscss provides very specific immutable defaults for things like margin, padding, and layout, Spector uses SCSS functions to provide ways to customize the number of classes you have of each property to allow you to always have the maximum amount of flexibility with the fewest possible classes.
